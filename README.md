## Project Inspiration: 
The College Where i'm Learning Right Now is an ICT focused private higher-learning institution in
Ethiopia. the college uses a manual or traditional system to manage the college’s library, most of
the thing such as; record of books, number of books in the library, record of members of the
library, record of members who have issued books, etc… are recorded using pen-paper system.
this kind of system requires lots of time and man power for performing simple operations in the
library. CLMS is a software application useful for librarians for management and handling of
typical task in the library.

## Drawbacks of existing system:
* record keeping is paper-based.
* there is high risk of data mis-management.
* librarian and students face a lot of problem while searching a book.
* the existing system is not efficient.

## proposed system:
the proposed system is developed after the analysis of drawbacks of the existing system.
using this software, a librarian can store information of all the books, with book title, author,
etc… available in the library, all the books available in the library can be displayed in a list so
that students need not roam through the entire library to find a book. moreover, the software
effectively maintains the details of members of the library to whom books have been issued and
also records of issued date and return date.
